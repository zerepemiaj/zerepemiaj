### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jaime and welcome to my Github Portfolio! :metal:
I'm a passionate software engineer currently learning ðŸŒ± on the **_Co Grammar Skills for Life Bootcamp!_** I have a background in retail managment and am transitioning into a career with technology!

### About me :point_up:
I am a dedicated and motivated individual who has a track record of leading teams and working well with others. I'm enthusiastic about learning Python and applying it in my many passions such as problem solving and building great applications! I also have a background in Kotlin/Android studios from a Udemy course which sparked my love for software development! :sparkles:

âš¡ Fun fact
Give a man a program, and frustrate him for a day. Teach a man to program, frustrate him for a lifetime. :sweat_smile:
